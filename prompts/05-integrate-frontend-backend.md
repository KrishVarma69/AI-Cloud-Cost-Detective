# Prompt 5: Integrate Frontend with Backend (End-to-End)

Connect the React frontend to the FastAPI backend. Wire up WebSocket for live progress, auth for all routes, and history display.

## What to build

### API Integration

- When the user clicks "Run Analysis", send `POST /api/analyze` with the selected region
  (and optional resource group) and JWT in the `Authorization` header.
- On the backend, validate the JWT on all protected endpoints (`/api/analyze`,
  `/api/history`, `/api/regions`, `/api/resource-groups`) using a FastAPI dependency.

### WebSocket Progress

- After triggering analysis, connect to `ws://localhost:8000/ws/progress/{analysis_id}`
  from React.
- Display each progress message in the `ProgressTracker` component as an animated step
  list.

### History + Reports

- History page fetches from `GET /api/history` with JWT.
- Clicking a past analysis opens the Report page with full details.

### Report Display

- Summary card at the top: total resources scanned, current monthly spend (Cost Explorer),
  issues found, estimated savings.
- Each issue shows: resource name / ARN, issue type (over-provisioned / unused /
  misconfigured), severity badge (high = red, medium = yellow, low = green), explanation,
  and a fix command in a copyable code block (e.g.
  `aws ec2 release-address --allocation-id eipalloc-0abc123`).

### Final Testing

- Test the full flow: signup → login → select region → run analysis → see live progress
  → view report → check history.

Refer to `Architecture.MD` and `RequestFlow.MD`. This covers the full end-to-end flow — steps ① through ⑦.
